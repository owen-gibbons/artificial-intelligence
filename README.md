# artificial-intelligence

This will hold my work relating to learning artificial intelligence, mostly through the Berkeley AI course and *Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach*.\
\
I will start this after I have done the Compilers and Distributed Systems courses, and I will probably want to review some linear algebra beforehand as well.
